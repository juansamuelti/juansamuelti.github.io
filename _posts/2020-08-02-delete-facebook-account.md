As facebook doesnâ€™t necessarily make this easy here are the stops to delete your facebook account.
First step is you will probably want to download your data.
Click the top right of any Facebook page and select Settings.
Click Download a copy of your Facebook data at the bottom of General Account Settings.
Click Start My Archive.
You will receive an e-mail with a link to download when your archive is ready.

Because this download contains your profile information, you should keep it secure and be careful when storing, sending or uploading it to any other services.

Next step is to go to <https://www.facebook.com/help/delete_account> click delete my account!
